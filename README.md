# Workbench

I'm a seasoned full-stack engineer specializing in building products from concept to launch. Right now I'm working on Cedar, the definitive platform for commercial development.
I was an early engineer at Cameo, joining the company in 2017 and leaving in 2023. During my time there, I worked across the stack and helped scale the platform to millions of users. During my last year, I led technology for the company's crypto efforts.
I started programming while serving as an infantry squad leader in the US Marines, and studied computer science at Dartmouth College after leaving the service.
