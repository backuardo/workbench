# Problem

A horizontal scroll bar appears on your website, and it's not immediately obvious which element is causing it.

# Solution

Copy and paste this snippet into your browser console, it will log all the elements that are causing the horizontal scroll.

```typescript
const documentWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;

document.querySelectorAll("*").forEach((node) => {
	if (node.offsetWidth > documentWidth) {
		console.log(node);
	}
});
```
