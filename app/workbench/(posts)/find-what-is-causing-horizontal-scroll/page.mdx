# Problem

Your website has a horizontal scroll bar, and you want to find out what is causing it.

# Solution

```typescript
const documentWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;

document.querySelectorAll("*").forEach((node) => {
	if (node.offsetWidth > documentWidth) {
		console.log(node);
	}
});
```
