# Build list

I was reading [Bone's website](https://bones-ai.bearblog.dev/) and liked the idea of a running list of projects I want to build in the future.

## [WIP] Drone swarm simulation

A drone swarm simulation built in Rust, capable of autonomous navigation, coordination, obstacle avoidance, mission execution, etc. Using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as the simulation engine.

## [Brilliant Pebbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Pebbles) simulation

[Brilliant Pebbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Pebbles) was a ballistic missile defense system proposed toward the end of the Cold War, consisting of thousands of small missile-bearing satellites.
If a missile was launched, it would be detected by the satellites, and the missile would be destroyed.

## Wi-Fi heatmap TUI

A terminal user interface (TUI) tool that helps find the strongest Wi-Fi network and determine the best location in a building by visualizing signal strength.
